  <h1>What is Open Source Music?</h1>

  Open source music is a reimagining of the way music is created and shared. It encourages an open development process where songs are created out in the open, allowing creators, fans, and enthusiasts the opportunity to contribute and influence the direction. The music is distributed under an open license allowing for anyone to use, modify, build upon, and profit from it. This results in a community-driven experience that fosters collaboration, idea generation, and learning. Making music can be difficult, time consuming, and requires a lot of different sets of skills and expertise; open source music allows creators to focus on their unique skill sets, they are able to focus on what they are good at and enjoy instead! Emulating the success of open source software, this model has the potential to reshape the way people interact with music, and increase accessibility for creators and consumers alike.

  In this guide, we‚Äôll explore the business case for open source music, its advantages, challenges, monetization opportunities, and why it is a viable option for both independent artists and established entities. I will cover my vision for open source music, as well as how I intend to bring it to life through Ghstng -- as a mentor of mine used to say, ‚Äúshow me, don‚Äôt tell me!‚Äù.

  This is a working guide; as I began compiling the contents I realized the scope was much larger than l had anticipated. In an effort to move forward creating the vision itself, I am committing to the principles of open source and building it out in the open. Feedback from the community is welcome. It is my hope that the ideas presented in this guide will evolve and improve over time through collaboration. Ghstng looks forward to releasing music under the open source model and moving this vision forward together with the community. üôè

<section id="introduction">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  Look at the credits of any major music release and you'll find a large team of individuals who worked on it, experts in their particular craft. In stark contrast stands the independent artist or aspiring creator attempting to compete at the same level with less experience, time, support, skill, and money. Creators spend precious time attempting to accomplish tasks they neither enjoy nor have the proper knowledge or time to be good at. The hope for many is to do enough to go viral and be seen by a label where they can get proper support. 

  How much talent and ability has been lost over the years because it didn‚Äôt have an avenue in which to be seen, or lost hope, or ran out of time? The beauty of open source is that it doesn‚Äôt require sex appeal, youth, experience, or money. It is a community of people learning and working together, benefiting together. The best creators and ideas rise organically; the community drives the direction. 

  If we broaden our perspective, we can also see that open source music is not relegated to the obvious tasks of music creation, like songwriting or performance. Making and sharing music involves a whole host of skills and roles including: designers, writers, photographers, stylists, videographers, managers, moderators, marketers, PR experts, influencers, legal, financiers, etc. Not being able to write a song or sing in key doesn‚Äôt exclude the community from participating or contributing. How many people with these skill sets are passionate about music? How many would jump at the chance to be able to contribute to a project or artist that they love. What if they could profit from it and turn it into a living? Open source music provides a gateway for anyone to get involved in projects that inspire them.

  All of this sounds great in theory you say, but isn‚Äôt the music being offered up for free? We will discuss monetization opportunities in a later section, but they are almost identical to those of the traditional model (with less cost up-front). It‚Äôs no secret the music industry has changed over the last several decades, transitioning from physical sales to digital, dealing with piracy, and navigating streaming. How has this affected the bottom line? Look no further than the move to [360 deals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/360_deal). For the majority of artists (not named Drake), less and less money is found in the sale of the music itself. Throw in the overreach of copyright law and this point is further exacerbated. It feels like the music industry has been stale for quite some time, unsure where to move next, allowing other industries to dictate its direction. Established systems always have a reluctance toward change, but music needs a solution for the modern age -- enter open source.

  The open source software community continues to increase in popularity. Its popularity is not based solely on lofty ethical or philosophical stances either. Open source offers a viable money-making opportunity for a broader spectrum of people. It is a model of doing business; one that has proven itself to be successful, not only for entrepreneurs and enthusiasts, but for established businesses as well. It facilitates a place for new ideas to be generated at a lower cost, for names to be built, connections to be made, and accessibility expanded. It is a model that can stand on its own, facilitate the transition to a more traditional model, or supplement an existing brand, driving traffic to its core products. It is a different paradigm of doing business. Why not bring it to music?

  <h3>Parallels</h3>

  Todo

  - Where did open source originate - super brief history?
  - What does it look like today?
  - What concepts are applicable to music (lamen‚Äôs)?
    - projects = single/album/other creative project
    - contributors = team of people contributing to project
    - roles
    - branches = revisions of a project for trying alt ideas
    - releases = releasing project in its final or stable form
    - songs have the ability to live on indefinitely even after a release also...
    - history = documenting how the song has changed over time
    - languages = daws, tech stack
    - stars = upvoting a project, showing how popular it is
    - watching = following a project
    - tags = genre, compositional elements, instruments
    - issues = comment system, making suggestions, highlighting issues
    - pull request = making contributions to current project
    - forking = copy a project in its current state to use as an external project
  - Miscellaneous parallels
    - Creation and distribution of Intellectual property
    - Reliance on copyright law
    - Piracy
    - Rapid pace of technological advancements, Cloud computing = Streaming
    - Open software licensing = Creative Commons
    - Both industries include stakeholders, creators, consumers, distributors, and investors -- music labels = venture - capitalists
    - Bootstrapping = Independent artists (no external funding ie. music label)
