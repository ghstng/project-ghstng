      <h2>What is 'Open source music'?</h2>
      <h5>(Short Version)</h5>
      <p>Open source music is a reimagining of the way music is created and shared. Projects are worked on out in the open. Fans can see the music they love evolving in real-time and other creatives can contribute to projects that catch their interest. Maybe you have the perfect guitar riff to finish a song? Perhaps you are the lyrical peanut butter to someone elses production jelly? This doesn't end with the music, releasing art involves so many things: design, photography, writing, on and on. Open source music is a community of creatives and enthusiasts helping and promoting each other, allowing each other to focus on what they do best, instead of trying to do it ALL.</p>
      <p>But wait, there's more ðŸ˜µðŸ¤­! Open source music is released under an <a href="/cc-plus/">open license</a>, so anyone can freely use, modify, build upon, or cherry-pick from the work. This includes everything from using it in social media, to classrooms, separate projects, or commercially (depending on the license).</p>
