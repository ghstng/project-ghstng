Met a girl once in Dallas
Princess in a plastic palace
Who couldn’t tell her lies from the truth
Love just a game she taunted
Men, pawns when she wanted
Attention never found in her youth

_She’s was poisonous
but I could not escape
I’m a masochist
I feed off the pain_

> How bad do you want it
  Tell me how much
  I’m off limits, off limits
  You can look but you can’t touch (2x)

Hazel eyes, knee high boots
Shoulder sprinkled with tattoos
Look a little deeper, only a ruse
She mirrors your reflection
She traps you in her web and
Leaves you hanging from her silk noose

_She’s was poisonous
but I could not escape
I’m a masochist
I feed off the pain_

_Chorus_

Break:
You know I’m thirsty, wanna sip of your love
You like to flaunt it, does the power give you a rush?
You got me begging, begging, begging for your touch...
When I know, when I know, 
You will never give it up
