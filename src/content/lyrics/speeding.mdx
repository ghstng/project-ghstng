Stay right there, gotta grab my keys, 
I’m on my way
On thirty five doing ninety nine 
down the interstate
Lights flash by, in hyperdrive 
and I can't wait
To see there-two-five written on the side 
of your driveway

> pedal down, heart beating
  anxious for this meeting
  all day long I’ve been feenin'
  speeding tonight
  want you bad, know I need it
  I’m southbound, tires screaming
  so revved up, you're the reason
  I'm speeding tonight
	
Almost there, three miles now, 
‘til I’m at your place
Won’t be satisfied til your dress is hiked 
up around your waist
Rain is picking up, but broken luck 
won’t break my pace
Cause I'm not letting, a single thing, 
stand in my way
-- getting late --

_Chorus_

Break:
Pulled in so fast, we forgot to shut the door  
Didn’t get too far, tangled down here on your floor
I'm here at last, no plans of going slow
And I'm still charged up, if we need to drive some more
