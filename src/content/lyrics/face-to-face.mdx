It's not that I'm blind
I see the two of us drifting
the distance is unkind
on the other side (of an ocean)
a day and one night
was all we had and
I’m thankful for that time
But can’t help but wonder

> If I was there in front of you
  Would it be the same?
  Would you push me to the side
  Tell me pretty lies
  if we were face to face?
  Memories have a way of changing
  Feelings can fade
  Could your heart find a way
  To make a little space
  If we were face to face?
 
If you gave a reason
I’d be a mile high
on the first plane out 
to see you (any reason)
you say it can’t be real
don’t believe that I’m not still
Somewhere there inside your mind
I think you might remember

_Chorus_

_Solo_

_Chorus_

Would it even make a difference?
