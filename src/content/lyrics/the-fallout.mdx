This can only end in flames
Tumbling down with no escape
Cause neither of us will change
Love, a fractured windowpane
Another stone until it breaks
We can never be whole again

_We can lie, we can lie, 
We can lie to ourselves
But everytime, everytime, 
It’s a silent cry for help_

> We’re just waiting for
  the fallout, the fallout, fallout
  That’s all we know
  We're a shit show
  We’re just waiting for 
  the fallout, the fallout, fallout
  Glue back the pieces
  Break, repeat it

Crumbled dust still on the floor
From our crash the time before
Sweep it under the rug again
Are we scared to be alone?
Is this cycle all we’ll know?
You have to admit this is crazy

_Tell me why, tell me why
Tell me why, we can’t change?
How many times, will we try
just to see it end the same?_

_Chorus_

Break:
...
