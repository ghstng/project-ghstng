intro:
we keep going back and forth and
I just can't seem to think straight
you know...
its like no matter what we do
we're right back here again

let me feel you one more time
before we call this over
only been a thousand times
we've spun this roller coaster
you and I go back and forth
and there's never closure
always both feet in the past

this noise in my head
is playing with me
is being with you
worth my sanity?

> I think I’m losing my mind
  think I’m losing my mind
  think I’m losing my mind
  think I’m losing my mind
  losing my mind
  think I’m losing my mind
  think I’m losing my mind
  think I’m losing my mind
  think I’m losing it

funny how you always show
right when I'm feeling better
know the perfect words to say
to wreck my brain like cancer
rip the pieces of my mind
then stitch them back together
like a bad pair of 90s blue jeans

this noise in my head
is falling off key
it's ringing louder and louder and louder
starting to think -- think

_chorus_

Break: 
feels like you're toying with me
not sure what I really see
still here, does it really mean
that there's real love underneath

_chorus_
