Rogue strands, angelic mess
Matted love, supple flesh
After a game of lovers chess
A quiet moment to reflect

_No makeup on, damn you're pretty
Clothes back on, oh what a pity
Don’t cover up, don’t be silly
You’re perfect right now_

> Curls going everywhere
  Dancing wild without a care
  It’s my favorite look you wear
  Bed hair, bed hair
  Ray of passion tangled there
  Let the daylight reappear
  Time is lost when you are here
  Bed hair, bed hair

Soft lines, exotic tones 
Like every shade was painted on
We share a vibe I’ve never know
That’s why I’m stalling again

_chorus_

_No makeup on, damn you're pretty
Clothes back on, oh what a pity
Don’t cover up, don’t be silly
You’re perfect right now_

Break:
Know you have to leave
Stay her for a minute
Know that we just met
Doesn’t make a difference
Tell me you feel it
Knew it the instant
You looked at me and smiled
It's cold outside
It's a long drive
Back where you’re staying
Please can we lay here
A little while longer
A little while longer

_chorus_
