Still keep your smile on a shelf
I should throw it out
But I keep it around 
Cause it makes me feel
Like just for a moment 
I’m next to you, next to you

_Days rewind 
Chilly night 
Only you and I
Warm inside
We laugh 
As you spill the wine
Try to hide 
Your face 
When you see the
Flash of a polaroid_

> Doesn’t change the fact
  You’re not coming back
  You’re still a smile on a polaroid
  Echo from the past
  Future that is trapped
  Here in the walls of a polaroid

The image is starting to fade
Swimming underneath a sea of 
Blueish green haze 
What hasn’t changed 
Is how it feels
Like you’re still here

_Instant high
Paralyzed
When your green eyes
Collide 
With mine
For a sliver of time
You and I 
Are happy
There in that polaroid_

_chorus_

Maybe your side of the story lies on a different page
Maybe the truth is somewhere in between all the shades of grey
Maybe a piece of me will always remain
Trapped in a square frame
With no escape, but either way...

_chorus_

You're just a smile on a polaroid
You're just a smile on a polaroid
