She kills the lit end of her cigarette
Walks by the ocean dodging waves of regret
They all stare but she keeps to herself
Making it clear that she needs no one else
  
> She wears black leather to the beach
  Wears her jacket dangling
  Off the corner of her shoulder 
  Like a movie poster
  She's always slightly out of reach
  Aimless rebel wannabe
  Thinks the world owes her
  Could never really know her
  Black leather

It's such a cold world, to be so alone
Always finding problems where there are none
But there’s a hidden beauty in her distant stare
Demanding attention, screaming that she’s there
  
_chorus_

Break:
Underneath all the mystery
Needless suffering
She so desperately
Wants to be like everybody else

_chorus_
