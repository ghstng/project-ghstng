Decorated, out of tune
Left for me and you
Curious too soon
Now here we are inside
I look back at you
See you feel it too
Tucked in body suit
Even though i'm not your guy

_Can't lie, i think it's crazy how the light, hits right
No aim, we always find the night, in sight
We’re here, so let's enjoy the ride_

> I just wanna lose myself in you
  Down on the floor of this empty room
  I just wanna feel your body move
  Tonight I wanna get in trouble with you
  I just wanna lose myself in you
  Everytime we meet its something new
  Always up to things we shouldn’t do
  Tonight I wanna get in trouble with you

Now we’re starting to
Feel the liquor move
These buttons are a little tricky
So tell me what to do
Not much time to lose
Security is loose
We’re running out time

_Can't lie, i think it's crazy how the light, hits right
No aim, we always find the night, in sight
We’re here, so let's enjoy the ride_
