On a cold monday; sold my soul for a taste of fame
Shady deal in the dead of night; to pave the way
Just a little ride; her silk legs crossed at the thigh
Begging me to cross the line, one last time 

_It happened in a second
Blindly misdirected
Diverted my attention
Thatâ€™s when she caught me slippin', slippin'_

> Heard her load the gun, no time to run
  Face down on the floor, damage done
  She set me up, how did I miss it?
  I should've seen, she had bad intentions

Sex and cigarettes, cold eyes filled with no regret
Venom on her blood red lips as she got dressed
All alone, stiff as stone, as the pain starts seeping in
My thoughts all start to drown, as I lose adrenaline

_It happened in a second
Blindly misdirected
Diverted my attention
That's when she caught me slippin', slippin'_

_Chorus_

Break:
Shots ring, debt paid
Escape; too late
