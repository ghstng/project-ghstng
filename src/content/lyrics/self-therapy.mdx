Guess I kept it all inside, 
didn’t realize
How much you changed me
Guess I lived my life
not feeling much at all, 
busy faking
Now I’m

_Moving through stages
Slowly rearranging
All of the things that
I found are worth saving
Find are worth saying
No longer waiting
Out flow the pages_

> Self-therapy
  Something I need for clarity
  It’s been a ride
  but I’m ready, think I’m ready
  To finally share the story
  Self-therapy
  Discovering what I couldn’t see
  In-progress
  but I’m ready, think I’m ready
  To finally share the story

I’ve been trying to find, some way that I
Could hide where I'm failing
Felt the stress landslide
And I can’t deny, the toll that its taking
Tried to

_Carry the weight but
The dam started breaking
Blind to the problem
Until it awakened
Deep seeded places
Deep seeded hatred
Been thinking lately_

_Chorus_

Break:
So if you don’t mind, don’t mind
I’d like to share the words I
Never meant to write
I’ve been keeping
All my, keeping all of my
Emotions caged inside
To protect my pride
