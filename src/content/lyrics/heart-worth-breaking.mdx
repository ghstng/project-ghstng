Sick heart, no remorse
She’s all fake emotion
Love her long enough
You only end up broken
She gives just enough
To bait you into hoping
If you stay long enough
Maybe her heart will open -- but

Love shouldn’t be this hard, 
Love shouldn’t be so hard
We are both worlds apart
Grasping in the dark

> Fix our love, girl what for?
  I don't care anymore
  We don’t have a love worth saving
  You don’t have a heart worth breaking
  Fight? please no more
  We've both said it all before
  We don’t have a love worth saving
  You don’t have a heart worth breaking

> You don't have a heart to break (4x)

Silent screams, sirens ring
no happy ever after 
all the lies, wonders why
I never write about her
wasted time, no more lives
on the final chapter
brace yourself, won’t end well
it’s headed for disaster

_Love shouldn’t be this hard, 
Love shouldn’t be so hard
We are both worlds apart
Grasping in the dark_

_Chorus_

Break:
You don't have a heart to break
You don't have a heart to break
You don't have a heart to break
You don't have a heart to break
