Can you make time, make time
To show me through your city
Don't feed me a fake line, 
I know it’s been a while
Get that you’re busy

I’ve come a long way
To speak to you face to face
I couldn’t take 
another text reply
If you say nothing’s changed
Swear I’m on my way
But I couldn't live
If I didn't try

> A mile high
  not much room
  I’m just writing this for you
  Here on a cheap plane
  Sleepless night
  Half past two
  I’m just searching for the truth
  Here on a cheap plane
  With no leg space

Promise I’m doing fine
not looking for your pity
But I felt a spark that
I couldn’t fathom
until it split me

Not like the movies,
Not like I can’t see,
That this probably
doesn’t end well
But since I met you I've 
Built you in my mind
And I need proof 
that it wasn’t real

_Chorus_

_Guitar Solo_

_Chorus_

One last moment at a small café
Still the way I remember you
We chat for a little while
at a corner table for two
Ask me not to stare the way I do
Ask me to see your point of view
We had a good time
...
