Damn you know how to make an entrance
In that backless dress, got my attention
If you need danger tonight, I’m on a mission
Got a license to kill, know I'm concealing

_Don’t just tease, baby that’s not fair
Talk a big game, but I think you’re scared
Leave with me, baby if you dare
Let’s get out of here_

> Ooh, baby that’s our cue
  Girl let’s make a move
  I’ll be James Bond tonight
  Ooh, time to love on you
  Like secret agents do
  I’ll be James Bond tonight

> I’ll be James Bond, 
  I'll be James Bond tonight
  I’ll be James Bond, 
  I'll be James Bond tonight

Wanna change roles? You can take the lead
Be the hero, use your best line on me
We can switch it up, I can play the villain
capture you and tie you up until you give in

_Now don’t just tease, baby that’s not fair
Talk a big game, but I think you’re scared
Leave with me, baby if you dare
Let’s get out of here_

_Chorus_

Break:
Banter in a dim lit room
Martini shaken, eyes on you
Let’s play bond tonight
If you’re down for something new
Something new
