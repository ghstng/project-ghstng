Broken by design
Exquisite and divine
the picture perfect lady
Red lips to ease the fate
The men who learn too late
She’s not their aphrodite 

_Spend it quick or she'll be gone
Glittering eyes won’t shine
Til they get what they want_

> Pink lights and champagne
  The plush life money brings
  Broke love doesn’t mean a thing
  She needs pink lights,
  Pink lights and champagne
  Pink lights and champagne
  To her its all a game
  Her love has no shame
  She wants needs pink lights,
  Pink lights and champagne
  (2x)

Passion’s not enough
The only kind of love
That will ever make her happy
The kind a heart can’t give
For life she wants to live
She will give her body gladly

_Spend it quick or she'll be gone
Glittering eyes won’t shine
Til they get what they want_

_Chorus_

Break:
High rollers look slick tonight
Cocktails well mixed tonight
Caviar on a crisp tonight
She has everything she wants
Right here in sight
