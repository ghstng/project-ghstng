Twenty twenty it's funny how, 
We thought we had love figured out
We could conquer anything
But hope got short, money got tight
Love got lost, we lost sight
Of who we vowed to be

_I believe that love is worth a fight
With a little hope and a spark of light_ 

> You and I can be 
  Two shadows dancing on the wall
  No worries at all
  Ascending into heaven 
  Pretending that we’re ten feet tall
  Refusing to fall, 
  Two shadows on the wall, the wall, the wall
  Two shadows dancing on the wall
 
Life doesn’t have a yellow brick road,
Just two of us, on our own
Fighting to make it out alive
Life is not as it appears
Sometimes love is bound by fear
Testing our strength to survive

_But I believe that love is worth a fight
With a little hope and a spark of light_ 

_Chorus_

Break:
We’re still standing; heads up high
All the things we thought we wanted
Didn’t stand the test of time
Nothing can stop us if we decide
We will rise --
And be shadows dancing on the

Out:
the wall, wall, wall
two shadows dancing on the 
wall, wall, wall
two shadows dancing on the wall
