Swank bar, crowded street
Foreign land, we meet
Tourists pass, window seat
Strange tongue, you speak
Fishnets, punk thing
Cool vibe, new scene
Still blend, you agree
Dark eyes, let's leave

> Take me to the motherland
  Pale skin melting in my hand
  Speechless, still you understand
  All new to this alien
  Take me to the motherland
  Don’t know if I’ll be here again
  Secrets coming to an end
  All new to this alien

Finish off our drinks
Tab out, taxi
Can’t wait, back seat
Old world, same need
Front door, stairs creak
Too loud, discrete (Shh)
Flat mate asleep
Door shut, pretty please

Break:
Where is home now?
I don't know now
Kinda funny how
its so familiar
different crowd
but I'm finding out
if you think about it
we're all alien
