Star crossed lovers
of our own free will
Mattress on the floor
where time stands still
All I need is you
in this world we built
Like Bonnie and Clyde

> Hellbound; baptized in sin 
  On the run; hear our names on the wind
  If I fall, it will be by your side
  Like Bonnie and Clyde

Steal each moment 
we’re young and alive
We’ll protect our love
with this forty-five
We are high on cash
Outlaws till we die
like Bonnie and Clyde

_Chorus_

Break:
We built our kingdom
from glass and bone
Dodged the bullets 
aimed at our throne 
And one day
we'll trade our crowns
for a pillows of stone
like Bonnie and Clyde

_Chorus_

-- that’s the price you pay for love
