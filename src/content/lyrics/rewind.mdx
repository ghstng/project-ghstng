Don’t believe, driving from the backseat 
Ghost to be, a California actress 
Dosed for free, that would be disastrous 
Don’t you think?
Way too sweet, laughing at the atlas 
Fall asleep, dream into the mattress 

> I got a glimpse of her life
  Kinda shit, that I like 
  Can we rewind the time
  I kinda wasted the night
  Holding on to the light
  Can we rewind the time

Most of me, well into the backstreets
Lost at sea, a killer who is tactless 
Rose to be, just another backless memory 
Go to meet, lean into the front seat 
Don’t delete, then it would be nothing 

_chorus (2x)_

Can we rewind the time
Can we rewind the time
Can we rewind the time
Can we rewind the time
Can we rewind the time, the time
Can we rewind the time, the time
Can we rewind the time, the time
Can we rewind the time, the time
Can we rewind the time, time, time
Can we rewind the time
