The first time I heard the words 'writers write' I was working with a wonderful woman by the name of Mary Dawson who was teaching me the art of songwriting. She would occasionally write for a blog by the same name, and I always remembered being struck by it. Initially, I found it a bit obtuse -- of course writer’s write, that’s why they call themselves that. But like many cliches in life, it often takes time to arrive at the heart of the meaning. You have to experience it; it has to be personal.

As I saw my brother Daniel lying in a hospital bed, I couldn’t help but put myself in his shoes. It was a tragedy. He arrived at the hospital thinking it was something relatively minor, only to learn he was in the last stages of pancreatic cancer and would not leave the hospital. A life turned into years, turned into months, turned into weeks, and while standing in his room, I couldn’t help but think of the life he was leaving behind. Danel Earl Garden was 10 years older than me, and for many years of my life an example of what not to be. That all changed when he met his wife and had two beautiful daughters. He became the embodiment of someone with something to live for, the embodiment of a husband and a father. He was hard working, humble, giving, and kind. As I watched him leave this world, I couldn’t help but wonder what I would leave behind, how I might be remembered. 

I am quite independent and live much of my life inside my own head. Skilled at many things, but not necessarily great at any. Relationships?... well, It's quite odd to be so romantically hopeful, while remaining so vehemently pessimistic. I have not been successful in love to say the least. I imagine at the heart of it is the fact that I am always busy working on some new interest or passion instead. I’ll dedicate years to a project, only to show it to a select few friends and family. This used to be something I was strangely proud of, being wholly content (perhaps piously) in my ability to create without the need for affirmation. I’ve kept much of my life to myself, only willing to share glimpses to friends and family, who even then, typically have to ask first.

It’s been a year since my brother's passing, but the words have appeared in my head again and  again since -- writer’s write. Whether I admit it, I consider myself to be many things: a creator, artist, lover, athlete, intellectual. But like a pea underneath the mattress of a princess, I can’t escape the gnawing uncomfort of those two words continuously questioning my being. If I claim, even if only to myself, to be a thing, where is the verifiable proof? What have I shared that is up for scrutiny or witness? The distance between capability and ability is vast.

For years I’ve thought of myself as a caged tiger, pacing, contemplating, studying my surroundings while sharpening my claws. I’ve been quietly waiting for the right moment when the door to my cage opens and I am released, armed with all the various skills and knowledge I've attained during captivity. I am realizing lately, however, that the metaphoric cage has been unlocked the entire time. In my endless pacing back and forth, I failed to even bother to check. I wasn’t abiding in a cage out of lack of opportunity to roam, but rather contentment in being confined, fearful of exposure.

I am no longer content. Writers write. Actors act. Players play, and so forth. I now choose to act upon the things I claim to be, embody them. For me this starts with sharing my music and art through ghstng. It's difficult to say what my expectations are in sharing. In life, just as soon as you proclaim something to be certain, you experience another side and realize it's not quite so black and white. But I can say this much with certainty, if I may be so bold, regardless of the expectations, circumstances, outcomes -- writers write.
