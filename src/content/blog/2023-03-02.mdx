Project Ghstng is launching today! I'm incredibly excited to get to share this with everyone. This is going to be a soft-launch, there are still a bunch of things that need to be tweaked, but as they say, "if it's perfect it's too late!".

Some notes:
 - all of the projects do have melodies, I just haven't had the chance to record them. ie. they exist, just in my head lol.
  - I have to go back and dig a little for the songs that were released last year. Some of how Tymothy and I worked last year making music, with him being in New Zealand and all, actually served as inspiration for the idea of Open source music.
 - many things will be changing and moving around. The second I started putting content in, I started getting ideas for improving the UI and experience. I'm sure this will be exacerbated once others are able to view the site and giving feedback.
 - In terms of the code itself, there are many things that could be optimized and better. The site is an MVP though, and is only meant to be a proof of concept. If it bothers you, than help me fix it!!... it's open source. 
 - I have a ton of ideas for what a proper app that others can use might look like, but time, money, buy-in, etc. It will come.

 I think that is it for now, my next major task will just be fixing issues and filling in content. Ironically, the music is what has taken the back seat these past many months! I intend on rectifying that.
