I'm not sure how to speak about myself without it sounding like a dating profile haha. I love to create, travel, attempt to learn new languages, and have watched the James Bond series more times than I can count. I'm always trying new things, but music remains the one I keep coming back to. My life is basically just a constant state of feeling like I'm pretty damn good at a thing, and then wondering why I even try the next day ðŸ˜†.
