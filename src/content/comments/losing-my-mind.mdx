  ** Note: hearing a glitch in the acapella -- not sure if is printing issue or actually glitch
  ** Note: hearing a lot of noise on the vocal also, maybe too hot going into the compression

  - Arranged the song some
  - Added bridge
  - Added some vocal adlibs, bgvs, doubles, throws and fx, think I'm mostly happy with vocal -- should have backed off mic some but wtvr, I'm recording in a crappy room
  - Added few misc drum things, but still need to do some proper production on the drums, still straight from VProm (linn drum emultation)

  - Added lead vocal, plain jane still, sparse, no bgvs/adlibs or anything
  - production really just enough to sing to, bass, linn drums, few guitar parts
  - honestly kinda like it basic -- one of my fav things about post-punk stuff (note to self: don't overdo it with the production)

  I wrote this after a terrible, but life changing summer... you know, when life is not going so great -- and then you're in a terrible relationship on top of it ðŸ˜³. The worst part, you're not even sure why you're still with the person -- maybe its just one less variable in a chaotic time.
  (Note to self: do a little youtube short on this -- too much to type -- Add to media section)
