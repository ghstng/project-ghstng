# Project Ghstng

This is the public code for [ghstng.com](https://ghstng.com). 

Project Ghstng is an Open Source Music project aimed at turning the concept into a reality. While the scope of what this site was meant to be has shifted... well... a lot, it is still only a basic proof of concept. What a full-fledged Open Source Music site might actually be is something else entirely, and something I intend on helping making happen.

Feel free to use this for your own project, or turn it into something else entirely (GPL-3.0 open source license). I don't consider myself a proper developer (I just really want to make Open Source Music a thing lol). If something really bothers you, or could be done better, create a PR and help :)
